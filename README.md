## General info

This project is designed and implemented in Java as a product of Object-Oriented Programming course. \Some OOP principles: SOLID - Single Responsibility Principle, Open Close Principle, Livskov Substitution Principle, Interface Segragation Principle,Dependency Inversion Principle are elaborately considered on the design of the project.

## Requirements
* Java SDK 14 
* JavaFX 15
* ScenceBuilder
* Controlsfx, jfoenix
* IntelliJ IDEA CE


## Setup
To run this project, you just need to install and add the required libraries to project.\
Change VM options:\
Run / Edit configurations / VM options: \
--module-path path-to-your-javafx-library --add-modules javafx.controls,javafx.fxml,javafx.base

## Basic Controls
You need to create a source and destination to start the pathfinding.

Our project supports 3 searching algorithms:
* Breadth first search (unweighted)
* Depth first search (unweighted)
* Dijkstra (weighted)

### Complicated Stuff
Those are the basics! Now you can be free to make the map as complicated as you desire. You can easily add weighted cells and walls.

### Maze
One more interesting point is that you can create maze and challenge the algorithms for find a path to reach the destination.
